OO Boot Camp in Java for client on 9-13 October 2017

Java is the most difficult to setup since there is a broad variety of Java
development tools (and versions). The following instructions are for installing
the code in IntelliJ 2017 by JetBrains. Adapt as necessary for your environment.

## IntelliJ setup
Open the reference code:
- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
  - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open"
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such:
    - File/Project Structure...
    - Select "Modules"
        -- Tag src directory as Sources
        -- Tag test directory as Tests
        -- Click "OK"

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and necessary libraries exist)
